# Instructions


## Currently, the map files are only available for Ireland-And-Northern-Ireland region.

_Large files cannot be pushed to GitHub due to a 100MB limit on file size._
Links to map files archives - 
1. Ireland and Northern Ireland - https://journear.blob.core.windows.net/data/europe_ireland-and-northern-ireland-gh-20200425T230621Z-001.zip


### Extract the archive `graphhopper-ie` in the `Downloads` directory of the phone to make the maps work.

### The behaviour of the maps without these files is not known right now. It could be an error or just fail silently. Will update this later.

Resulting path -
> /Download(s)/graphhopper/maps/europe_ireland-and-northern-ireland-gh
